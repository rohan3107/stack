## Summarization of given code:  
This codebase represents the Stack Auth project, an open-source authentication and user management solution intended to be a developer-friendly alternative to services like Clerk and Auth0. It offers features like:  

- Pre-built UI components for sign-in, sign-up, account settings, etc. 
- Support for various authentication methods, including OAuth, email/password, and magic links. 
- Integration with a powerful admin dashboard for managing users, teams, permissions, and more. 
- A flexible REST API that can be used with any backend. 
- Features for user onboarding, connecting OAuth accounts (e.g., Gmail, GitHub, OneDrive), team management, and role-based access control (RBAC). 

The code is structured as a monorepo, with separate packages for: 

- Frontend components, SDK, and UI elements. 
- The backend API server, database, and email service. 
- End-to-end (E2E) testing, OAuth mocking, and documentation generation.  

### Inputs:  
- User authentication details (email, password, OAuth tokens, etc.)  
- API keys for project access (publishable client key, secret server key, etc.)  
- Configuration options for projects, teams, users, and authentication methods.  
- User requests for various actions, such as sign-in, sign-up, password reset, team invitation, etc.  

### Outputs:  
- User authentication tokens (access tokens, refresh tokens).  
- User and team data, including profiles, metadata, and permissions.  
- UI components for rendering authentication pages and flows.  
- API responses to user requests.  
- Webhooks for server-side event notifications.  
- Emails for user verification, password reset, and team invitations.  
- Documentation for the REST API and SDK.  

The code is designed to be modular and extensible, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined interfaces. It leverages various technologies, including:  

- Next.js for both the frontend components and the backend API.  
- React for building UI components.  
- Prisma for database management and schema migrations.  
- Svix for webhook management.  
- Inbucket for a local email server in development.  
- OAuth4WebApi and OpenID Client for OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration.  
- Yup for schema validation and data parsing.  
- JOSE for JWT signing and verification. 

The project's architecture and code organization make it easy to understand and contribute to. It is a good example of a modern web application built with best practices and using a wide range of technologies.
