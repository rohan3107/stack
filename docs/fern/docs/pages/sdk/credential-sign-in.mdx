# CredentialSignIn

A React component that renders a form for signing in with email and password credentials.

## Props

This component does not accept any props.

## Example

```tsx
import { CredentialSignIn } from '@stackframe/stack';

function SignInPage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Sign In</h1>
      <CredentialSignIn />
    </div>
  );
}
```

This component handles form validation, submission, and displays error messages. It uses the `useStackApp` hook to access the application's sign-in functionality.
